/*
  We have a set of 100 clients that have purchased various amount of products in our service.
  Our analytics platform is not suited for it so we want to build a short script that can always answer a few questions for us:
  1. What is the distribution of clients based on the # of orders? (How many purchased 1, 2, 3, etc)
  2. What is the mean volume(in $) of our clients total value?

  The raw data is a json file at:
  https://gist.githubusercontent.com/conanbatt/9da0470db6cf90c61324f8365d448a92/raw/caa9c9e8d365abd374b5d2e1ef0f380b75d45962/.json
